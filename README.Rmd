title: "R Package GWASpoly"
output: github_document
---

This package was designed for genome-wide association studies in  autopolyploids but  also works for diploids. A [vignette is available](https://jendelman.github.io/GWASpoly/GWASpoly.html) to illustrate the basic workflow using the potato dataset that comes with the package. More detailed information is available in the [package reference manual](https://jendelman.github.io/GWASpoly/GWASpoly_manual.pdf).

If you use the package in a publication, please cite
[Rosyara et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2015.08.0073).

The original development of the package was supported by the USDA NIFA SCRI (Award No. 2011-51181-30629) and Hatch (Accession No. 1002731) programs. Beginning Fall 2020, new features are being added as part of the SCRI Project "Tools for Genomics-Assisted Breeding in Polyploids" (Award No. 2020-51181-32156).

To install and load the package:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jendelman/GWASpoly", build_vignettes=FALSE)
library(GWASpoly)
```
